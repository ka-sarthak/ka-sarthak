- 👋 Hi, I’m Sarthak Kapoor, a master's student in Simulation Sciences at RWTH. 
- 👀 I’m interested in modelling physical processes by simulating the underlying PDEs. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about solving PDEs using learnable mapping, especially with neural operator approach. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on intersting topics around machine learning, surrogate modelling using learnable mappings, and operator-based learning. 
- 📫 Reach me at sarthak.kapoor@rwth-aachen.de
