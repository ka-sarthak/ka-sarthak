- 👋 Hi, I’m Sarthak Kapoor, a final-year master's student in Simulation Sciences at RWTH. 
- 👀 My interests lie in the confluence of machine learning, applied maths and physics.
- 🌱 My current work, at Chair for Material Mechanics in RWTH, focuses on solving equations of mechanical equilibrium in material microstructures using CNNs and operator-based learning.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on intersting topics around machine learning, surrogate modelling using learnable mappings, and operator-based learning. 
- 📫 Reach me at sarthak.kapoor@rwth-aachen.de
